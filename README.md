# struts2-app-engine-ecommerce-web-site
Online shop for Google App Engine (written when App Engine was in its infancy). 

This was my first major web application project that I wrote in 2012. It's way out of date now. and probably wouldn't run on the current Google App Engine. However, at the time it was a complete and useable web application fit for trading.

Tech of interest here is: Stuts2, Paypal API Integration, JSP.
