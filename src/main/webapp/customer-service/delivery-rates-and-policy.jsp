		        <h3>(1) Introduction</h3>
	            <p>This delivery policy gives details of the delivery methods, delivery periods and delivery charges that apply to any orders for our products made through our website or by email or telephone.</p>
	            <p>This policy is not intended to and does not create legally enforceable rights and obligations.  It merely indicates our usual practice in relation to the delivery of products.</p>
	            
                <h3>(2) Delivery methods</h3>
                <p>We will deliver to the following countries and territories: United Kingdom, Ireland, United States of America, Canada and all European Union countries.</p>
                <p>If the address for delivery of your order is a UK mainland address, then the following delivery method will be used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>standard delivery.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the address for delivery of your order is not a UK mainland address, then the following delivery method will be used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>standard international delivery.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>(3) Delivery periods</h3>
                <p></p>
				<table> 
				    <thead> 
				        <tr> 
				            <th>Delivery method</th>
				            <th>Typical delivery period</th> 
				        </tr> 
				    </thead> 
				    <tbody> 
				        <tr> 
				            <td>Standard delivery</td> 
				            <td>1-2 working days</td>
				        </tr>

				        </tr> 
				    </tbody>
				</table>
                <p>If you place your order before 3pm on a working day, these periods run from the close of business on that day.  If you place your order after 3pm on a working day, or on a non-working day, these periods run from the close of business on the next following working day.</p>
                <p>These periods are indicative only, and whilst we will make every effort to ensure that you receive your delivery in good time, we do not guarantee delivery before the end of the specified period.</p>
                <p>If you purchase a high value product from us, we will usually conduct fraud screening checks before dispatching the product.  These may delay the expected date for delivery.  Where the delivery date is delayed as a result of fraud screening checks, we will notify you by email.</p>
                
                <h3>(4) Delivery charges</h3>
                <p>Delivery charges will be calculated and automatically applied to your order during the checkout process.  The applicable charges will depend upon:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the location of the delivery address.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Indicative charges (stated in GBP and inclusive of applicable VAT although this may not be payable in all instances) are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>standard delivery of a package to a mainland UK address: GBP 1.50.</li>
                    <li>standard international delivery of a package to a non-UK mainland address: GBP 2.50.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>(5) Delivery problems</h3>
                <p>If you experience any problems with a delivery, please contact us by email to sales@groovyfly.com or through our website at <a href="/customer-services/contact">http://www.groovyfly.com/customer-services/contact</a></p>
                <p>If our delivery service provider is unable to deliver your products, and such failure is your fault, and you do not collect your products from our delivery service provider within the time specified on the card left at your address, then we may agree to arrange for re-delivery of the products, providing that we reserve the right to charge you for the actual costs of re-delivery (even where the initial delivery was free-of-charge).</p>
                <p>An indicative list of the situations where a failure to deliver will be your fault is set out below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>you provided the wrong address for delivery;</li>
                    <li>there is a mistake in the address for delivery that was provided;</li>
                    <li>the address for delivery is not reasonably accessible;</li>
                    <li>the address for delivery cannot safely be accessed;</li>
                    <li>where in person receipt is not required, there is no easy and secure means of leaving the products at the address for delivery and there is no person available to accept delivery; and</li>
                    <li>where in person receipt is required, there is no person available at the address for delivery to accept delivery and provide a signature.</li>
