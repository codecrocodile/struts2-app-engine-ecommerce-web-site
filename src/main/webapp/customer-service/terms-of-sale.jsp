        <h4>Official Groovy Terms of Sale</h4>
        <div class="toggle_content">
            <div class="inner"> 
            
            <h3>(1) Introduction</h3>
            <p>Please read these terms of sale carefully.</p>
            <p>You will be asked to expressly agree to these terms of sale before you place an order for products from our website.</p>
            
            <h3>(2) Interpretation</h3>
            <p>In these terms of sale, “we” means Groovy Fly (and “us” and “our” will be construed accordingly); and “you” means our customer or potential customer for products (and “your” will be construed accordingly).</p>
            
            <h3>(3) Order process</h3>
            <p>The advertising of products on our website constitutes an “invitation to treat”; and your order for products constitutes a contractual offer. No contract will come into force between you and us unless and until we accept your order in accordance with the procedure detailed below.</p>
            <p>In order to enter into a contract to purchase products from us, you will need to take the following steps: (i) you must add  the products you wish to purchase to your shopping cart, and then proceed to the checkout page; (ii) you choose checkout the items in your shopping cart; (iii) you will be transferred to the PayPal website, and PayPal will handle a payment acknowledgement for your order; (iv) you will be transferred back to our website, where you will choose to acknowledge the order payment (at which point your order will become a binding contract); (V) we will then send you an a sales receipt and order confirmation to your email address.</p>
            <p>We will not file a copy of these terms of sale specifically in relation to your order. We may update the version of these terms of sale on the website from time to time, and we do not guarantee that the version you have agreed to will remain accessible. We therefore recommend that you download, print and retain a copy of these terms of sale for your records. </p>
            <p>The only language in which we provide these terms of sale is English.</p>
            <p>Before you place your order, you will have the opportunity of identifying whether you have made any input errors by using the "amend order" button. You may correct those input errors before placing your order by editing the text fields presented to you.</p>
            
            <h3>(4) The products</h3>
            <p>Fly fishing flies, fishing tackle, software, images.</p>
            
            <h3>(5) Price and payment</h3>
            <p>Prices for products are quoted on our website. The website contains a large number of products and it is always possible that some of the prices on the website may be incorrect. We will verify prices as part of our sale procedures so that a product's correct price will be stated when you pay for the product.</p>
            <p>In addition to the price of the products, you will have to pay a delivery charge, which will be as stated when you pay for the product.</p>
            <p>Payment must be made upon the submission of your order. We may withhold the products and/or cancel the contract between us if the price is not received from you in full in cleared funds.</p>
            <p>The prices on the website include all value added taxes (where applicable).</p>
            <p>Payment for all products must be made by credit card, debit card, PayPal transfer OR any method detailed on the website from time to time.</p>
            <p>Prices for products are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect contracts which have come into force.</p>
            <p>If you dispute any payment made to us you must contact us immediately and provide full details of your claim.  If you submit an unjustified credit card, debit card or other charge-back then you will be liable to pay us, within 7 days following the date of the charge-back: (i) an amount equal to the amount of the charge-back; (ii) all third party expenses incurred by us in relation to the charge-back (include charges made by our or your bank or payment processor or card issuer); (iii) an administration fee of GBP £10 (including VAT); and (iv) all our reasonable costs, losses and expenses incurred in recovering the amounts referred to in this paragraph (including without limitation legal fees and debt collection fees).</p>
            <p>Without prejudice to our other rights, if you submit an unjustified credit card, debit card  or other charge-back, then we may terminate any contracts between you and us under these terms of sale by giving you written notice of termination.</p>
            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, if you fail to recognise or fail to remember the source of an entry on your card statement or other financial statement, and make a charge-back as a result, this will constitute an unjustified charge-back.</p>
            
            
            <h3>(6) Your warranties</h3>
            <p>You warrant to us that:</p>
            <ol class="lower-alpha">
                <li>you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts, and you have full authority, power and capacity to agree to these terms of sale;</li>
                <li>the information provided in your order is accurate and complete;</li>
                <li>you will be able to accept delivery of the products;</li>
                <li>you are resident in the USA, Canada, Ireland, England, Wales, Scotland or any other EU country;</li>
                <li>you are at least 18 years of age.</li>
            </ol>
            
            
            <h3>(7) Delivery policy</h3>
            <p>We will arrange for the products to be delivered to the address for delivery indicated in your order.</p>
            <p>We will use reasonable endeavours to deliver products on or before the date for delivery set out in our order confirmation or, if no date is set out in our order confirmation, within 7 days of the date of our order confirmation. However, we cannot guarantee delivery by the relevant date. We do however guarantee that unless there are exceptional circumstances all deliveries of products will be dispatched within 30 days of the later of receipt of payment and the date of our order confirmation.</p>
            <p>We will only deliver products within the USA, Canada, Ireland, England, Wales, Scotland or any other EU country.</p>
            
            <h3>(8) Risk and ownership</h3>
            <p>The products will be at your risk from the time of delivery. Ownership of the products will only pass to you upon the later of:</p>
             <ol class="lower-alpha">
                <li>delivery of the products; and</li>
                <li>receipt by us of full payment of all sums due in respect of the products (including delivery charges).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We will be entitled to recover payment for the products even where ownership has not passed to you.</p>
            
            <h3>(9) “Cooling off” period</h3>
            <p>Under the Distance Selling Regulations, you may cancel a distance contract to purchase a product or products from us at any time within 7 working days after the day you received the relevant products or products (subject to the limitations set out below).</p>
            <p>In order to cancel a contract in this way, you must give to us written notice of cancellation.</p>
            <p>You will not have any such right insofar as a contract relates to: (i) the supply of any products which constitute audio or video recordings or computer software which have been unsealed by you; (ii) the supply of newspapers, periodicals or magazines; (iii) the supply of goods made to your specifications or clearly personalised.</p>
            <p>If you cancel a contract on this basis, you must promptly return the products to us, in the same condition in which you received them.</p>
            <p>If you cancel a contract on this basis, you will be refunded in full (including the cost of sending the products to you). However, you will be responsible for paying the cost of returning the product to us.</p>
            <p>If you cancel a contract on this basis and you do not return the products to us, we may recover the products and charge you for the costs we incur in doing so. Similarly, if you return the products at our expense, we may pass that expense on to you.</p>
            
            <h3>(10) Statutory rights</h3>
            <p>Nothing in these terms of sale affects your statutory rights (including your right to receive a refund in respect of any defective product we sell to you).</p>
            
            <h3>(11) Refunds</h3>
            <p>If you cancel a contract and are entitled to a refund, we will usually refund any money received from you using the same method originally used by you to pay for your purchase. We will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any event, within 30 days of the day we received your valid notice of cancellation.</p>
            
            <h3>(12) Limitations and exclusions of liability </h3>
            <p>Nothing in the terms of sale will: (a) limit or exclude the liability of a party for death or personal injury resulting from negligence; (b) limit or exclude the liability of a party for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation by that party; (c) limit or exclude any liability of a party under Section 12, 13, 14 or 15 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 or Part I of the Consumer Protection Act 1987; (d) limit any liability of a party in any way that is not permitted under applicable law; or (e) exclude any liability of a party that may not be excluded under applicable law. Any statutory rights which you have as a consumer, which cannot be excluded or limited, will not be affected by the terms of sale.</p>
            <p>The limitations and exclusions of liability set out in this Section and elsewhere in the terms of sale: (a) are subject to the preceding paragraph; and (b) govern all liabilities arising under the terms of sale or in relation to the subject matter of the terms of sale, including liabilities arising in contract, in tort (including negligence) and for breach of statutory duty.</p>
            <p>We will not be liable to you in respect of any losses arising out of any event or series of events beyond our reasonable control.</p>
            <p>We will not be liable to you in respect of any business losses, such as loss of or damage to profits, income, revenue, use, production, anticipated savings, business, contracts, commercial opportunities or goodwill.</p>
            
            <h3>(13) General terms</h3>

            <p>Contracts under these terms of sale may only be varied by an instrument in writing signed by both you and us. We may revise these terms of sale from time-to-time, but such revisions will not affect the terms of any contracts which we have entered into with you.</p>
            <p>If any provision of these terms of sale is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect, and such invalid or unenforceable provisions or portion thereof will be deemed omitted.</p>
            <p>No waiver of any provision of these terms of sale, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, will be deemed to be, or be construed as, a further or continuing waiver of that provision or any other provision of these terms of sale.</p>

We may assign, charge, sub-contract or otherwise transfer any of our rights or obligations arising under these terms of sale, at any time – providing such action does not serve to reduce the guarantees benefiting you under these terms of sale.</p>
            <p>Each contract under these terms of sale is made for the benefit of the parties to it and is not intended to benefit, or be enforceable by, any other person.
