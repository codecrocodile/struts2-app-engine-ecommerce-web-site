      <p>
         If you are not happy with any of the products you buy from Groovy Fly then send us an email to let us know what seems 
         to be the problem. We are more than <b>happy to exchange or refund</b> the cost of the products. We wouldn't sell 
         anything that we wouldn't be 100% happy to use ourself. Having said that, mistakes happen on the very rare occasion, but 
         you can be rest-assured that the same mistake donesn't happen twice at Groovy Fly.
