		       <dt>The colours of my flies are sightly different from what is displayed on the website. Why is that?</dt>
		       <dd>Computer screens differ in they way they display colours. It might be that your screen does not display exactly the same range of colours required. This would account for a sightly variation. It may also be the fact that some flies are made from natural products which inherently vary in colour.</dd>

               <dt>I would like some custom patterns tied. Do you do that?</dt>
               <dd>No, sorry we don't do that. Most of our flies are tied in factories around the world. The lead time, quality control and cost make this infeasible.</dd>

               <dt>Do you sell wholesale flies and/or fly collections?</dt>
               <dd>Not at this time, feel free to register your interest in that with us though. There are some legalities we would need to deal with first and if enough companies are interested then it would make this financially viable for us.</dd>

               <dd>We have a carefully selected range unlike many other companies that have thousands of flies that don't sell. We also don't want to have you look through too many variations on flies that do the same job.</dd>
