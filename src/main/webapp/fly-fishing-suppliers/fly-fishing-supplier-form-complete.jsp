    <p>We are very pleased you took the time to fill out our registration form. If you would like to send us a small sample of your flies, you can do so by sending 
        them to the following address. Alternatively, you can wait until we contact you.</p>
        
     
    <ul class="list13"><li>Groovy Fly, 3 Aillort Place, East Mains, East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, G744LL</li></ul> 
    
	<h2>Supplier Selection Process</h2>
	    
	<p>We do not purchase from all of the suppliers that register with us, but we will take every registration under consideration.</p>
	
	<p>Our process for supplier selection is as follows:</p>
	
	<ol>
	    <li>On a periodic basis we review registrations taken from our supplier registration forms
	    and select those we think meet our business and quality requirements.</li>
	    <li>We will ask you to supply us with a small sample of flies for inspection (we are happy to pay for this of course). Usually a sample 
	    of 12 - 24 flies is requested. These will be selected by us from your standard product list.</li>
	    <li>If the sample passes our quality control inspection we may then ask you to tie a sample of custom flies that we require. These will also undergo a quality control inspection.</li>
	    <li>On having passed our quality control inspections we may place a small order (usually about 200 - 300 dozen flies).</li>
	    <li>A number of small orders will be placed with you (usually about 200 - 300 dozen flies) until we are happy with the consistency of the flies.</li>
	    <li>When we are happy that we are doing business with a great company we will then begin to place orders that fulfil our own business requirements.</li>
	    <li>If we decide that we would like you to become one of our main suppliers, we may ask to visit your company at an agreed date.</li>
	</ol>
