    <h3>Groovy Fly on privacy...</h3>
    <img alt="ICO Logo" src="images/ico-logo.png"  class="imgborder alignleft" />
    <p>
    Data about you and your actions are collected every time you go online. In fact, it it pretty much impossible to avoid given the current 
    technology the Internet and the World Wide Web is based on. Most data is collected by websites to enable or enhance features such as 
    shopping, recommendations and preferences. Some unscrupulous companies can misuse that data, but Groovy Fly is certainly not one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
    We are a small business and truly value our customers and as such would not under any curcumsancies compromise their trust by the known misuse their
    data. Having said that, we do need to keep within a legal framework and not just a moral one. You will find below our official policy document outlining
    the use of your data on this website. If you want to find out about data protection principles you can do so by following this link to 
    the <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)</a> website.

		    <h3>(2) Cookies</h3>
		    <p>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</p>
		    <p>We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser.  Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</p>
		    <p>We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website; keep track of items in your shopping basket; prevent fraud and increase website security; and to provide a customised user experience of our website. We will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit; keep track of your preferences in relation to the use of our website; and to provide a customised user experience of our website.</p>
		    <p>We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website.  Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers.  The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information.  Google's privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.</p>
		    <p>Our advertisers/payment services providers may also send you cookies.</p>
		    <p>Our advertising services providers may send you cookies for the purpose of enabling the service of advertisements based on your previous visits to our website.</p>
		    <p>We may publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website.  These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests.  To determine your interests, Google will track your behaviour on our website and on other websites across the web using the DART cookie.  You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using Google's Ads Preference Manager, available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/.  You can opt-out of the Adsense partner network cookie at: http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/ or using the NAI's (Network Advertising Initiative's) multi-cookie opt-out mechanism at: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.  However, these opt-out mechanisms use cookies, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you should use the Google browser plug-in available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin.</p>
		    <p>Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies.  For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.  Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.</p>
